# Overview
-----------
Bee-Ground is an open-source simulation tool based on Unity and Unity Machine Learning Agents which can be applied to the research on aggregation of swarm robots, especially the swarm robots controlled by the bio-inspired algorithm BEECLUST. MONA[1] is the modelled robot in this simulation software, however different robotic platform can be easily developed in Bee-Ground.

* • Bee-Ground is an open source, cross-platform simulation tool
* • Bee-Ground can simulate the operation of swarm robots in various complex and dynamic environments, including obstacles and multiple heat source scenarios. 
* • Bee-Ground performs multi-layer multi-scenario simulations simultaneously, and the simulation speed can reach 100 times as the real-time without loosing sampling resolution.
* • Bee-Ground provides extended possibilities for application of machine learning technics in swarm robotics.

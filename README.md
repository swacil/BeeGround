# Overview
-----------
Bee-Ground is an open-source simulation tool based on Unity and Unity Machine Learning Agents which can be applied to the research on aggregation of swarm robots, especially the swarm robots controlled by the bio-inspired algorithm BEECLUST. MONA[1] is the modelled robot in this simulation software, however different robotic platform can be easily developed in Bee-Ground.

* • Bee-Ground is an open source, cross-platform simulation tool
* • Bee-Ground can simulate the operation of swarm robots in various complex and dynamic environments, including obstacles and multiple heat source scenarios. 
* • Bee-Ground performs multi-layer multi-scenario simulations simultaneously, and the simulation speed can reach 100 times as the real-time without loosing sampling resolution.
* • Bee-Ground provides extended possibilities for application of machine learning technics in swarm robotics.


Arena settings
The parameters of arena dimensions can be adjusted in this part and the obstacles and temperature are generated by array files.
Robots settings
The default settings of robots (here using MONA[1] as an example) including size, forward speed, turn speed, sensor range, and wait time are initialized here.
Simulation setting
Simulation duration and number of iterations are defined in this step.

# Installation
## Step 1. Download a Beeground version from the folder 01 Version
Download a Geeground version from the folder 01 Version, here I will use "BeeGround Ver. 1.0" as an example. Unzip the zip file in your local.
## Step 2. Download the latest Unity from the Unity official website
